# Eye Blink Detection

## Overview
The Eye Blink Detection project is a computer vision-based application designed to monitor eye movements and detect blinks in real-time. It uses facial landmarks to identify and analyze eye regions, offering an efficient solution for applications like fatigue monitoring and interactive systems.

## Features
- **Real-Time Processing**: Detects eye blinks from live camera feeds or pre-recorded videos.
- **Accurate Landmark Detection**: Utilizes facial landmarks to locate and analyze eye regions.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Thresholds can be fine-tuned for varying light and video quality conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For video processing and feature detection.
- **Dlib**: For facial landmark detection.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JoySeedhe/Eye-blink.git
   cd Eye-blink
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python blink_detector.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure your webcam or external camera is connected.
2. Launch the application using the command:
   ```bash
   python blink_detector.py
   ```
3. The system will detect and highlight blinks in the video feed.
4. Adjust the blink detection threshold in the script if needed.
